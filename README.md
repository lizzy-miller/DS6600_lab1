# Why did I picked license GNUGPLv3.0. 

I selected GNUGLP v3.0 for the following reasons. First, this license allows for both commercial and non-commercial use. In addition, it provides permissions for distribution and modification. I specifically selected GNUGLP v3 because it states that the modifications must be released under the same license or under a similar/related license. I interpreted this as meaning that this license does not permit anyone to modify and/or distribute this code with a more restrictive license. 

The reason why you would want to select a license is because the failure todo so results in the default US copyright laws to apply, meaning that I would retain all of the rights to my code. Therefore, no one would be able to use my code. If I wanted to promote open source and sharing with data and code, the failure to select a license would be counterintuitive. Hence, selecting a license such as GNUGPL or MIT helps promote code and data sharing. 

# Why I know my .ENV will not be pushed to GitHub. 

Because on my .gitignore it says: 

# Environments
.env
.venv
env/
venv/
ENV/
env.bak/
venv.bak/
