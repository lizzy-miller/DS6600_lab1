# Step 3 Describe, in words, why the following is true. 

1. **Virtual Machine** because the Meals on Wheels needs a method in which every chapter can utilize the same portal and app created by the Charlottesville chapter. In addition, they need a large amount of storage space due to the size of their database. Although a virtual machine is difficult to set up, Meals on Wheels has help from some UVA computer science students and WillowTree to guide them towards success. A global environment would be completely insufficient to complete this task as the default system on each computer is not able to access the Charlottesville system. Since we need to specify the specific software being used by Charlottessville, a virtual environment would also be insufficient. A container may be sufficient to complete this task; however, since there is a large amount of data being processed than this may be too big to fit on any individual laptop or computer. <p>
2. **Global Environment** because Legal Aid Justice Center is only asking for a report, not requiring any code or data to be shared. Hence, a global environment is sufficient to complete this task. Anything above a global environment, such as a container, virtual environment, or virtual machine, would be overkill because the specific program, the system does not need to be specified nor does this project require large memory space. <p> 
3. **Container** because not only do the software packages (e.g., Python) but also the software system needs to be specified (e.g., Linux). These tasks would not be capable of being completed through a global environment nor virtual environment. There does not seem to be a need to use a virtual machine because it is expensive and there does not appear to be the need for additional storage space. <p>
4. **Virtual Environment** because we only need a place in which to run different versions of python, such as Python 3 and Python 4. Thus, you can practice Python 4 in your virtual environment without worrying about it affecting your other projects. In fact, you could move your other projects running on Python 3 into your virtual environment in order to preserve them. A global environment is insufficient to complete this task because you cannot run multiple python versions on your computer at the same time. The specific software package does not need to be specified; hence a container is not required. In addition, a virtual machine would be overkill and expensive for you swedish-python learning expedition.
